## The assignment
The time scope for this project was set to three weeks of part time (50%) work and we ended up spending more time than that. The project was planned with an MVP and stretch goals, where we have fulfilled the MVP but did not have enough time to take on the stretch goals. The frontend is built using React with Redux for state management, Styled Components for styling and the backend is built with Express.js and MongoDB with Mongoose.
